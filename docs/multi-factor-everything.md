# Multi-Factor Everything

One of the coolest features of Valist is that there is a multi-factor system for everything. With multi-factor everything you can eliminate single points of failure within your software supply chain and have all actions audited and approved from members across your organization.

## How it works

You may have heard of the [two man rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-man_rule) an authentication mechanism designed to prevent accidental or malicious launch of nuclear weapons by a single individual. This mechanism requires the presence of two authorized individuals, **with special keys**, to perform a nuclear strike. Valist applies this same concept to software distribution. When enabled multi-party verification requires operations be verified and digitally signed by multiple members within your organization before being finalized.

## Organization vs Repo Level

On the **organization** level organization admins are able to vote on:

* Adding new organization admins to the organization

On the **repository** level members are able to vote on:

* Approving a new repository threshold for votes.

* Adding a new developer key to the repository.

* Revoking an existing developer key from the repository.

## Voting on Access Control
